/**
 * Past-conversation-summaries grounding source for Quinn (P2-A.4).
 *
 * A fourth `KnowledgeSource` (see `./retrieval-sources`) alongside the
 * knowledge base, feedback posts, and admin-curated snippets: retrieval over
 * `conversation_summaries` rows (see `./conversation-summary.service`),
 * generated once per conversation when it closes. Ranking is semantic
 * (pgvector cosine over `conversationSummaries.embedding`) when a query
 * embedding is available, keyword (ILIKE over the summary text) otherwise —
 * mirrors `snippets-retrieval.ts`'s two-path shape.
 *
 * THE SAFETY-CRITICAL DIFFERENCE from every other source: this one is scoped
 * per CUSTOMER, not per audience ceiling. `ContentAudience` governs how
 * privileged a piece of CONTENT is (public/team/internal); it says nothing
 * about WHOSE history a viewer may read. A conversation's own summary is
 * never more than as private as that customer's other conversations, so the
 * ceiling plays no role here — the mandatory predicate is
 * `visitorPrincipalId = <the current conversation's customer>`, always, on
 * every surface. Without it, one customer's support history would leak into
 * another customer's answer, which is a severe breach — worse than getting
 * the audience ceiling wrong, since the mistake crosses tenants' own
 * customers rather than merely over-sharing content tier.
 *
 * `retrieveConversationSummaries` enforces this by refusing to run at all
 * without a `customerPrincipalId`: a caller with no real customer to scope to
 * (the admin sandbox, or a context nobody threaded a conversation into) gets
 * `[]`, never an unscoped query. Never relax this into "no filter" as a
 * fallback — a missing scope must read as "nothing", not "everything".
 * registered per the agent's config-v3 knowledge toggles (resolveAssistantKnowledgeSnapshot)
 * `resolveKnowledgeSources`), default off.
